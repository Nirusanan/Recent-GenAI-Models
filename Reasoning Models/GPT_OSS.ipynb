That simplifies to x^5 + 3x^4 - 13 = 0. We need to find roots. It's a quintic polynomial: x^5 + 3x^4 - 13 = 0. Can we find rational roots? Potential rational roots: ±1, ±13. Try substituting x=1: 1+3-13=-9. x=-1: -1+3-13=-11. x=13: huge 13^5 +... huge positive minus 13. x = -13: huge negative minus 13. So no integer root. Maybe rational like ±13, ±1, ±13, ±... nothing else. Maybe root is something like 1? No. Might have one real root and others complex. Use numeric methods. Let's find approximate real root. Let f(x)=x^5+3x^4-13. The dominant term for large negative x: x^5 term dominates. f(-2)= (-32)+3*16-13 = -32+48-13=3. f(-3)= -243 +3*81 -13 = -243+243-13 = -13. So there's a root between -3 and -2. f(-2.5)=(-97.656)+3*39.06-13 = -97.656+117.187-13=6.531. f(-2.7)=(-143.489)+3*53.084-13 = -143.489+159.252-13=2.763. f(-2.8)=(-172.103)+3*61.337-13 = -172.103+184.011-13=-1.092? Wait 3*61.337=184.011: sum is 11.908? Let's compute accurately: f(-2.8) = (-2.8)^5 + 3*(-2.8)^4 - 13. -2.8^5: -(-2.8^5?) Actually (-2.8)^5 = -(-2.8)^5? Let's compute (-2.8)^5 = - (2.8^5) = - (2.8^4 *2.8) = -(61.337 * 2.8) = -171.687. Approx. Next, (-2.8)^4 = 61.337. times 3 = 184.011. So sum: -171.687+184.011-13 = -0.676? Actually -171.687+184.011=12.324, minus 13 = -0.676. Good. f(-2.75) = (-2.75)^5 +3*(-2.75)^4 -13. (-2.75)^5: 2.75^5= 2.75^4*2.75. 2.75^2=7.5625, ^4=(7.5625)^2 = 57.191, *2.75=157.270. negative: -157.270. (-2.75)^4=57.191*(something)? Wait compute: 2.75^4 = (2.75^2)^2 = 7.5625^2 = 57.191. times 3 = 171.573. Sum: -157.270+171.573-13 = 1.303? Actually -157.270 + 171.573 = 14.303, minus 13 = 1.303. So f(-2.75)=1.303. f(-2.78): Let's approximate. 2.78^2=7.7284, ^4=7.7284^2=59.739, ^5=59.739*2.78=166.147. negative: -166.147. *3 for 2.78^4 => 3*59.739=179.217. Sum: -166.147+179.217-13 = 0.070. So f(-2.28? Actually -? Wait we used -2.78 gave 0.07. f(-2.79): 2.79^2=7.7841, ^4=7.7841^2=60.577, ^5=60.577*2.79=169.006. -169.006 + 3*60.577=181.731 -13 = -0.275. So root between -2.78 and -2.79 where f crosses zero. But earlier f(-2.75) positive 1.303, f(-2.78)\n"

Let's think: There is Priya (female). She has 3 siblings who are brothers. Each brother has two sisters. Priya presumably is one of the sisters for each brother? Let's parse: \"Priya has 3 brothers and all brothers have two sisters each.\" Typically this puzzle implies that the brothers each have 2 sisters total, which includes Priya and maybe another sister. We need to find number of sisters that Priya has. That means how many sisters does Priya have? If the brothers have two sisters each, then each brother has two sisters. In this family, the siblings include Priya, her brothers, and possibly other sisters. For each brother, there are exactly two sisters, meaning the number of sisters total is 2. However, if there are other sisters beyond Priya, they'd also be sisters to the brothers. Let's carefully count: Let S = number of sisters of the family. We know Priya is one of those sisters. Brothers: 3. Brothers each have two sisters; so the total number of sisters is 2. But we might need to consider that for each brother, they all share the same sisters if they are siblings. Therefore, the family has 3 brothers and 2 sisters. The question: \"Priya has 3 brothers and all brothers have two sisters each, how many sisters does Priya have?\" If she is a sister, obviously she has 1 sister? Wait what is the phrasing: \"Priya has 3 brothers and all brothers have two sisters each, how many sisters does Priya have?\" So what does \"Priya has 3 brothers\"? That means Priya's siblings include 3 brothers. She might have also other siblings (i.e., sisters). We are asked: how many sisters does Priya have?\n",
            "\n",
            "Given that all brothers have two sisters each. So there are two sister siblings for each brother, but if there's only two sisters in the family, they'll share them. So number of sisters in the family is 2. If Priya is one of those sisters, then she has 1 sister left in addition to herself. But wait: Are the two sisters the only sisters? If both brothers have exactly 2 sisters, those two sisters belong to the group as siblings, maybe same two sisters.\n"
